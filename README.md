# Mapping Eathquakes

## Purpose and Overview of Project

The Mapping Eathquakes Challenge utilized many resources that are outlines below. Specifically, GeoJSON was the driving resource that helped pull in map data in more digestable format suchasd JSON. This allowed me to create multiple maps comparing the intensity of earthquakes across the globe. Other important tools I used were APIs from Mapbox and Leaflet that allowed me to create eye-cathcing and intriguing maps through map layers and styles.
